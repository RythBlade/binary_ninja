Still to do:
- Pointer to pointer
- Array of pointers to things
- Variable length arrays
- Unit tests!!
- can't use the string "file" anywhere in the script - need a proper keyword system!
- Missing a file name knocks the whole thing out of whack! Need a proper error!

- text dump of pointers needs implementing properly
